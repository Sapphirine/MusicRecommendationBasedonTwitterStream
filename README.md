# MusicRecommendationBasedonTwitterStream

We set up a music recommender website using twitter streaming data and explore the sentimental analysis to decide the recommended items.
The twitter test dataset was extracted by some music keywords from twitter streaming API. The train dataset was from the website sentiment140. We use the NLTK to preprocess the raw data and countvectorizer, tfidfvectorizer to extracted feature. Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic regression and linear SVM were chosen to train the classifier model by mahout and python. Evaluate three models and test the best one through twitter streaming data. Finally show the recommendation result by the website which is formed through javascript.
